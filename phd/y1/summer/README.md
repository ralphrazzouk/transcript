# SUMMER 2024

This semester was my first summer semester as a Ph.D. student in physics at Purdue University. In this semester, I did not take any classes, but did a research course with a professor in S-matrix gauge theory bootstrap and convex optimization using Python. This [link](https://github.com/ralphrazzouk/s-matrix-bootstrap) will take you to the repository where all the work was done (if publicized).
