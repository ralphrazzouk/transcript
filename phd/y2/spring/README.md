## PHYS 580 - Computational Physics

In this course, we went over numerical methods and computational techniques for physics problems, including decay processes, projectile motion, nonlinear systems, physical pendulum, planetary motion (including Saturn-Hyperion system), electromagnetic field calculations (parallel-plate capacitor and magnetic field), statistical physics simulations (random walk, percolation, Ising model with Monte Carlo methods), molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics (1D square well/barrier).

## PHYS 603 - Methods of Theoretical Physics III

In this course, we went over advanced mathematical methods for theoretical physics, with focus on group theory and its applications. Topics included character theory for finite groups with applications to molecular vibrations, tensor methods for the rotation group SU(2) with applications to atomic physics, and representation theory for higher-rank Lie algebras with applications to particle physics. We covered Schur's Lemma, Jacobi identity, Wigner-Eckart theorem, tensor operators, roots and weights, Gell-Mann matrices, simple roots, Cartan matrix, Dynkin diagrams, Dynkin coefficients, Weyl group, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, Gell-Mann-Okubo formula, and Young tableaux.

## PHYS 663 - Quantum Field Theory II

In this course, we went over advanced topics in quantum field theory, continuing from PHYS 662. Topics included renormalized perturbation theory and effective actions, renormalization group flow (Wilsonian renormalization, Callan-Symanzik equations, critical exponents, Wilson-Fisher fixed point, nonlinear sigma model), gauge theories and nonlocal observables, quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories (Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian, asymptotic freedom, confinement), spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism, anomalies (chiral and scale), the Standard Model of particle physics (particle content, spectrum, strong and electroweak interactions, anomaly cancellation), and modern topics including operator product expansion, entanglement in quantum field theory, magnetic monopoles, theta-angle, instantons, and large N expansion.

## MA 572 - Algebraic Topology

In this course, we went over the foundations of algebraic topology, beginning with the zoo of topological spaces and their properties (compactness, connectedness, separability, homotopy equivalence) and constructions (quotients, group actions, gluing, mapping cylinders, cones, suspensions). We studied the fundamental group, Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, and amalgamated free products of groups. We covered covering space theory, including the universal cover, Ï€1-action, Galois correspondence, and connections to sheaf theory. The course culminated with homology and cohomology theory, including singular homology, CW/simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, duality theory, and cohomology with non-trivial coefficients.
