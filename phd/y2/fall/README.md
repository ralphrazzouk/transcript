## MA 562 - Introduction to Differential Geometry and Topology

In this course, we went over differential topology, the study of smooth manifolds and smooth functions between them, as well as basics of Riemannian geometry. Key topics included Whitney embedding theorem, Stoke's theorem, the hairy ball theorem, de Rham cohomology groups, Riemannian geometry of curves and surfaces, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

## PHYS 570AI - AI and Physics

In this course, we went over foundational and applied machine learning topics for analyzing large scientific data. The first half focused on machine learning fundamentals including statistical learning, optimization, and various algorithms (Deep Neural Networks, CNN, GNN, Transformers). The second half involved course projects, literature discussions, and guest lectures on AI and physics research. Topics included probabilistic programming, generative models (RBMs, VAEs, GANs), ML hardware, and supervised/semi-supervised/self-supervised learning approaches.

## PHYS 662 - Quantum Field Theory I

In this course, we went over classical field theory to quantum fields, following the progression from classical particles to quantum fields. Topics included actions and the principle of locality, conserved charges and symmetries, Lie groups and representations, Lorentz and Poincar√© group representations, canonical quantization, correlation functions, path-integral quantization for free and interacting fields, and quantum electrodynamics including loop amplitudes. The course provided a thorough foundation in quantum field theory principles and applications.
